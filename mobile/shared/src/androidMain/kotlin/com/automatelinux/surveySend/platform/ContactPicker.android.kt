/**
 * Android's own contact picker.
 *
 * ACTION_PICK on the Phone table returns the URI of the ONE phone row the user
 * chose, carrying a temporary read grant with it. Querying that URI therefore
 * needs no READ_CONTACTS permission and shows no permission dialog — the user
 * already granted access by choosing the person, which is the only access the
 * app has any business having.
 *
 * Picking the Phone table rather than the contact means a person with three
 * numbers is disambiguated in the system UI, where the numbers are visible,
 * instead of by us guessing at "the first one".
