 * this is built on a Mac.)
 *
 * The Android implementation goes through the OS picker, which hands back a
 * one-shot read grant for the row the user chose — so the app reads exactly the
 * contact he picked and never holds READ_CONTACTS. An app that asks for the
 * whole address book to save four seconds of typing has taken far more than it
 * needed.
